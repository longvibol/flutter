Week 4 Layout Homework 

- what we need to lean for the layout : SingleChildScrolView, ListView, PageView, NetedScrolView 

More detail : https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout

1. Upper case text 

- Text("call".toLowerCase(),)

2. Text : write in paragraph 

Text(''' 
                  Hello My name Vibol
                  '''),

យើងដាក់ ''' ___ ''' ចឹងពេលយើងចង់សរសេរហើយមិនចាំបាច់ចុះបន្ទាត់ទេ

3. Padding ជុំវិញ

padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10,horizontal: 20),

4. Scrollbar យើងដាក់ដើម្បីអោយវាមាន សញ្ញា scroll 

5. SingleChildScrollView ពេលមានបញ្ហា គាង Yellow វានឹងចេញអត់អោយឃើញ view Te ចឹងយើងត្រូវ ​Wrap វាជាមួយ SingleChildScrollView

Right click on body : Colum() then wrap with widget (typing : SingleChildScrollView) ចាំដាក់អក្សរធំ បានចេញ

Ex: 


body: Scrollbar(
        child: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: [
              Image.asset(
                "assets/products/layout.png",
                width: double.infinity,
                height: 250,
                fit: BoxFit.cover,
              ),
