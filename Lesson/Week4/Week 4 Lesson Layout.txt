'Lake Oeschinen lies at the foot of the Bl√ºemlisalp in the '
        'Bernese Alps. Situated 1,578 meters above sea level, it '
        'is one of the larger Alpine Lakes. A gondola ride from '
        'Kandersteg, followed by a half-hour walk through pastures '
        'and pine forest, leads you to the lake, which warms to 20 '
        'degrees Celsius in the summer. Activities enjoyed here '
        'include rowing, and riding the summer toboggan run.',
